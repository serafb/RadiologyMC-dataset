  "options": "Ventricular effacement | Sulcal effacement | Mass with central enhancement | Mass with peripheral enhancement | White matter oedema",
  "correct_answer": "Mass with central enhancement",
  "explanation": "A large mass in the left cerebral hemisphere is causing mass effect with effacement of the sulci and left lateral ventricle (asterisk).\nLow density surrounding the mass indicates vasogenic oedema of white matter.\nThe mass enhances peripherally but not centrally. The central portion of the mass is avascular due to cell necrosis.\nNote:Abscess is a differential diagnosis",
