The previous image is relevant to chest X-ray interpretation and should be viewed as a matter of routine whenever interpreting a chest X-ray.\nImage 1 shows classic features of severe pulmonary oedema; the upper zone vessels are enlarged indicating pulmonary venous hypertension, bilateral shadowing indicates alveolar oedema, and bilateral costophrenic blunting indicates pleural effusions.\nThe combination of severe pulmonary oedema in a patient with previously documented cardiomegaly is consistent with the diagnosis of heart failure.",

This is causing mass effect evidenced by the effacement of the sulci on this side of the brain and shift of midline structures.\nThe post-contrast image shows enhancement of brain tissue surrounding the low density area.\nThis mass lesion appears intra-axial (intracerebral) rather than extra-axial (outside the brain).\nAlthough it is possible that a metastasis has this appearance, there is only one lesion and so it is not ‘multiple’.\nThe appearances are not consistent with an acute primary intracerebral haemorrhage which would be of high density (white) on the pre-contrast image.",

      "correct_answer": "Abnormal low density of white matter representing cerebral oedema",

The post-contrast image also shows multiple other foci of enhancement. These are typical appearances of brain metastases.\nBoth the pre and post-IV contrast images show a large area of abnormally low density within white matter due to cerebral oedema.\nAcute bleeding results in areas of high density on the pre-contrast image which would not enhance post contrast.\nThere is no intracerebral calcification visible on these CT images.",

Image quality is non-diagnostic.\nA repeat scan later showed no acute abnormality.
