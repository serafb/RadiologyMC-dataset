Sarcoidosis usually causes bilateral hilar enlargement and areas of consolidation. Mesothelioma usually presents with signs of pleural disease such as a pleural effusion or pleural thickening. Lung volumes are normal and there is no evidence of reticulation (net-like appearance) of the lungs, so fibrosis is an unlikely cause. A thymoma usually causes widening of the upper mediastinum which appears normal in this image.

In the context of head injury, the crescent-shaped layer of bright material seen over the right cerebral hemisphere represents a recent bleed \u2013 a subdural haematoma. Mass effect is visible. The right lateral ventricle is effaced and there is shift of midline structures to the left. The roll-over image demonstrates an altered window setting which makes it much easier to see the blood separate from the brain and skull.
