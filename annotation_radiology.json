  "correct_answer": "There is free intra-abdominal gas visible under the left hemidiaphragm",
  "explanation": "An erect chest X-ray is more sensitive for detection of free gas than an abdominal X-ray. This image shows a small volume of free gas under the left hemidiaphragm. This may be seen following abdominal surgery, but in the context of a patient presenting with abdominal pain this finding indicates perforation. This is not the stomach bubble. Chilaiditi’s syndrome – gas within a loop of bowel located between the liver and the diaphragm – is more typically seen on the right and does not result in formation of a crescent-shaped rim of gas under the diaphragm as is seen in this image.",

  "explanation": "Increased density and air bronchogram in the right upper zone indicate consolidation, but no chest X-ray is in itself diagnostic of lung cancer or pneumonia. Compare with the normal left upper zone.

This is not because of a right middle lobe pneumonia or rotation, but rather because the heart is displaced to the left due to pectus excavatum. The ribs are angled such that they take on more of a ‘7-shape’ rather than   their normal ‘C-shape’. Even if the right side of the heart was in line with the right edge of the spine, the heart size would still be within normal limits. If you think your patient has pectus excavatum on the basis of a chest X-ray, then the diagnosis should be confirmed on clinical examination.",

  "explanation": "The endotracheal tube tip is located approximately 3 cm above the carina. If anything, it should be withdrawn a little. There is no reason to remove the right internal jugular catheter. For long term use it may be appropriate to advance further. The nasogastric tube has passed down the right main bronchus into the right lung. It should be removed.

  "correct_answer": "Surgical emphysema",
  "explanation": "The chest drain is not fully inserted into the thoracic cavity and placement has been complicated by extensive surgical emphysema over the left side of the chest. The heart appears enlarged but the image is Anterior-Posterior (AP) so the heart size cannot be assessed accurately. Although the right costophrenic angle is not included on the image there is no clear reason to retake the X-ray as the clinical question has been answered.",

  "explanation": "The image shows dense consolidation in the lower zones, worse on the left. In this clinical context the most likely cause is an aspiration pneumonia. The lack of the clinical features described at the time of admission rules out a community acquired pneumonia.

The hemidiaphragm contours remain domed and the anterior ends of the 7th ribs intersect the mid-clavicular lines at or below the diaphragm. The breasts are very slightly asymmetric; as they are in most normal subjects. Previous breast surgery is not a diagnosis made with an X-ray – ask the patient or check the notes.

  "options": "Sarcoidosis | Mesothelioma | Pulmonary fibrosis | Thymoma | Primary bronchogenic lung carcinoma",
  "correct_answer": "Primary bronchogenic lung carcinoma",
  "explanation": "There is a large rounded area of increased density in the right lower zone, and enlargement of the right hilar structures. Sarcoidosis usually causes bilateral hilar enlargement and areas of consolidation. Mesothelioma usually presents with signs of pleural disease such as a pleural effusion or pleural thickening. Lung volumes are normal and there is no evidence of reticulation (net-like appearance) of the lungs, so fibrosis is an unlikely cause. A thymoma usually causes widening of the upper mediastinum which appears normal in this image. The area of density in the right lung base is due to a lung mass and the enlarged right hilum is due to enlarged lymph nodes in this area. The most likely diagnosis is a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.",

The hemidiaphragms are flattened and located below the level of the 7th ribs indicating the lungs are hyperexpanded. The lungs also appear of generalised low density. These are features of emphysema and so a history of long-term smoking is likely – 35 years in this patient. Hyper-resonance would likely be bilateral in this patient. The heart is not enlarged. ",

  "correct_answer": "Changing window settings would help clarify the diagnosis",
  "explanation": "Image quality is often sub-optimal in acutely unwell patients. An attempt at diagnosis should still be made. The image demonstrates a subdural collection on the right. In the context of head injury, the crescent-shaped layer of bright material seen over the right cerebral hemisphere represents a recent bleed – a subdural haematoma. Mass effect is visible. The right lateral ventricle is effaced and there is shift of midline structures to the left. The roll-over image demonstrates an altered window setting which makes it much easier to see the blood separate from the brain and skull. Although subdural and subarachnoid bleeding may coexist there is no evidence of subarachnoid blood in this image. Anticoagulation is a risk factor for intracranial bleeding of all kinds.",

  "explanation": "The image shows a large area of high density in the right frontal lobe due to acute bleeding. The CT was non-contrast and so this can’t be an enhancing mass. Its position indicates it is in the brain (intra-axial) rather than extra-axial, so subarachnoid and subdural haemorrhage are ruled out. The focus of high density in the posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle is the calcified choroid plexus, a normal finding.",
